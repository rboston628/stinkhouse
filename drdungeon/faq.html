<h1>DR DUNGEON FAQ</h1>

<h2>Q: Is this even real?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
In a world of screen-saturated work and entertainment, 
where your toaster needs an app, where your social life is contained in your phone... 
yes, this is exceedingly real.
</p>

<h2>Q: How did you make your fliers?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
I drew them, by hand.  
The flier represents the service I am selling: 
honest, organic gaming with human imagination.
</p>


<h2>Q: What exactly is Dr. Dungeon?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Dr. Dungeon is an old-school gaming experience, offering analog dungeoneering to the Knoxville area.  
The game runs on the table, with pen, paper, dice, miniatures, and imagination.  
There are no electronic devices allowed at my table.  
The goal is to unplug and enjoy real people while playing an imaginary game.
</p>


<h2>Q: Is this for adults, or for children?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Both! You bring the group, and I will bring the dungeon.  
If children are playing, the intake form will have disclosures and agreements about content.  
</p>


<h2>Q: What if I don't have a full group?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
This is a new operation and I haven't yet setup the logistics for pairing new players to groups.  
But don't despair!  I plan for eventual age-bracketed groups, age ranges 11-14, 14-18, College, and Adult.  
Fill out an intake form and indicate you do not have a group.
</p>
<p>Or email me directly to arrange a solo campaign.
</p>


<h2>Q: Where do we meeet?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
I will go to you.  
As needed, I can arrange a semi-public venue (such as library or community center room).
</p>


<h2>Q: Are there really no screens or phones?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
There are no tablets, phones, laptops, virtual tabletops, TVs, or any of it.  
I will take all notes on paper, and you will do the same.  Phones will be kept out of reach, on Do Not Disturb.
</p><p>
If you absolutely expect an important call (such as a parent, or wife going into labor), 
you may put that contact to an allow-list.  
Otherwise, you will not be able to see your device; it will stay stored even while you use the bathroom.
</p>


<h2>Q: Is there a particular ruleset being used?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b>
The first "D&D" game I played was a puzzle-book maze that my friend littered with locked doors, swords, and monsters. 
There were no particular rules; we just "did".
</p><p>My first true rulebook was Holmes Basic D&D (the "bluebook").  
I have played with Chainmail + OD&D, AD&D (1E), Basic D&D (Holmes, B/X or OSE), 3E, 5E, and DCC.  
If you know you have a preference, then you may state so.  
Regardless of the rules, the style of play will aim towards classic, old-school gaming.
</p>


<h2>Q: What does old-school gaming mean?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Focus on immersive play in the world of the game, and the exploration of the underground world of the dungeon, 
rather than on character builds, game mechanics, or balanced combat encounters.  
The internal logic of the game world is as much a determining factor as dice rolls.  
</p><p>
Play is classic pen-and-paper, with a mix of theatre-of-the-mind and miniature figurines.  
Your skill and imagination as a player is more important to success than the boxes on your char sheet.  
The dungeon is the underground world of the unknown, full of horrible monsters and deadly traps; 
you don't know what you will find, or if you will survive.
</p>


<h2>Q: What does "Gygaxian" mean?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b>
Gary Gygax was one of the two visionaries behind D&D (with Dave Arneson).  
Gygaxian can refer to the florid style of prose used in his dungeons and the original Dungeon Master's Guide.  
It can also refer to play which is unbalanced, unpredictable, and highly deadly, requiring wise choices from players.
</p>


<h2>Q: What do I need to bring?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
You do not need anything except an imagination and the right attitude.  
And some loose paper, pencil, and a pen.  Also snacks.  And bring enough snacks for everyone.
</p>


<h2>Q: When will we make our characters?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
My goal is that from the moment we sit down, the game will be as much continual action as possible.
</p><p>
To this end, character creation will use a "funnel" system.  You will create four characters.  
Each will be created in approximately thirty seconds by rolling 3d6 down the line.  
In the first adventure, all of them will due but one.  That sole survivor will continue as your character to the next adventure.  
That tale of how you survived will be your backstory.  
This system takes focus off of game mechanics and char-builds, and puts it back to immersive play.
</p>


<h2>Q: Who are you?</h2>
<p><b>A:</b> 
My name is Reece Boston, PhD. 
During the day I am a physicist at the nearby lab.  
I live in the Knoxville area with my wife and two children, and we are active members of a local church.  
In the past I have been a university professor, a high school teacher, and a software engineer.  
That said, my games are not about physics, education, or software; they are about monsters, dungeons, and adventures.
