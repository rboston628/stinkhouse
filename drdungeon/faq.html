<!-- GENERAL QUESTIONS -->
<h2 id="general">General Questions</h2>

<h3>Q: Is this real?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
In a world of screen-saturated work and entertainment, 
where your toaster needs an app, where your social life is contained in your phone... 
</p><p>
Yes, this is exceedingly real.
</p>

<h3>Q: What exactly is Dr. Dungeon?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Dr. Dungeon is an old-school gaming experience, offering analog dungeoneering to the Knoxville area.  
The game runs on the table, with pen, paper, dice, miniatures, and imagination.  
There are no electronic devices allowed at my table.  
The goal is to unplug and enjoy real people playing an imaginary game.
</p>

<h3>Q: Who is this for?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
This is ideal for teens, young adults, families, or newcomers who want to enjoy real D&D with real people.  
You bring the group (3-6 players), and I will bring the dungeon.  
If children are playing, the intake form will have disclosures and parental agreements.
</p>

<h3>Q: What if I have never played before?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Then this is exactly what you need to get started.  I will handle the materials and complexity.  You show up and play.
</p>

<h3>Q: Do I need to know the rules before I can play?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
NO!  You do NOT need to know the rules to play.
</p><p>
The first "D&D" game I ever played was a puzzle-book maze that my friend littered with locked doors, swords, and monsters. 
There were no particular rules; we just "did."  That is really what D&D is: structured, principled imagination.
</p><p>
When knowledge of a rule is required, I will explain the rule and how it might impact your character.
</p>

<h3>Q: What do I need to bring?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
You do not need anything except an imagination and the right attitude.  
And some loose paper, pencil, and a pen.  Also snacks.  Bring enough for everyone.
</p><p>
If you have your own dice, or your own miniatures, please do bring them, but that is not required.
</p>

<h3>Q: Can't I just play with my friends for free?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Of course you can.  You've always been able to.  But you haven't.
</p><p>
There is a certain amount of inherited knowledge to running a game.  
This is a majorwall that most new hopeful players hit: 
You aren't fully sure how to play, and you can't really learn it all from the book.
</p><p>
If nothing else, after playing a few sessions with me, you will better understand how to run your own games.
</p>


<!-- BOOKING AND LOGISTICS -->
<h2 id="logistic">Booking & Logistics</h2>

<h3>Q: How many players?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Between 3-6 players, for ideal interaction.
</p>

<h3>Q: How long is a session?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
A normal session is from 2-4 hours.
</p>

<h3>Q: Where do we meeet?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
I am your traveling DM-for-Hire.  I will go to you.
</p><p>
As needed, I can arrange a semi-public venue (such as library or community center room).
</p>

<h3>Q: Which areas do you serve?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
I am serving the Knoxville area.  
</p>

<h3>Q: Who else is playing?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
	The other people at the table will be your friends, and no one else.
</p><p>
	I am not currently able to arrange paring new players with groups.  <a href="#solo">See below</a>.
</p>

<h3>Q: How is this priced?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Price is per session: $150 for 3-6 players, 2-4 hours.  All materials are included.
</p><p>
If play goes over 4 hours, it is $40 for each additional hour.  
I will notify before going into overtime.
</p><p>
If I need to arrange renting a venue, I will add that to the total price.
</p>

<h3>Q: How do I sign up?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Click here and fill out the form, and then I will be in touch to schedule the meeting.
</p>

<h3>Q: Do you require booking a minimum number of sessions?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
The minimum number of sessions is one (1).  Happy to do one-shots, or longer campaigns.
</p>

<h3 id="solo">Q: What if I don't have a full group?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
This is a new operation and I haven't yet setup the logistics for pairing new players to groups.
</p><p>  
But don't despair!  I plan for eventual age-bracketed groups, age ranges 11-14, 14-18, College, and Adult.  
Fill out an intake form and indicate you do not have a group.
</p><p>
Email me directly to inquire about solo campaigns.
</p>

<h3>Q: Do you require prepayment?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Yes.  There is a lot of unseen work that goes into preparation, especially for a live game.  
I need to prepare and stock a dungeon, setup towns, adventures, and encounters, and find the correct props 
to use to build immersion.  Even for a pre-written adventure I have seen before, 
I have to do this in advance of gameday in order to deliver a quality service.
</p>

<h3>Q: Can I get a refund if I need to cancel, or cannot show up?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
	Yes.  If you cancel one week in advance of the scheduled session, then you can receive a full refund.
</p>
	Otherwise, no.  I will have already done the work to prepare, and 
	will have already blocked off the time we were supposed to meet.
</p><p>
	If given enough notice, we can move a time or day, if the new time is 
	close enough to the originally scheduled time.
</p><p>
	For issues on my end, you will receive a full refund.
</p>


<!-- GAMEPLAY EXPERIENCE -->
<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay Experience</h2>

<h3>Q: What exactly happens in a session?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
D&D is principled imagination, with a judge (the DM) to resolve outcomes.  The players imagine themselves as 
figures from heroic fantasy stories (their characters), living in a world of knights, dragons, monsters, and magic.  
The adventure will take them deep underground into ancient ruins and dungeons searching for treasure.  
This adventure might be represented analogously with miniatures, drawn maps, handouts, or props.
</p><p>
When a player wishes to perform any action (open a door, look for treasure, fight a monster), the player describes that his character does 
(e.g. "I throw burning oil on the zombie").  The DM will explain on what conditions the action succeeds, and then state what follows 
the character's actions.
</p><p>  
This will normally be a dice roll.  
</p><p>
In this way, the players collectively build a shared story as they explore the fantastical world of the game.
</p>
<!-- <p>
However, the kind of story created in a game is not like the story you read in a book.  It is more like the story you read in history.  
Good games that are turned into books make for lousy books, and good books that are turned into games make for lousy games.  
The important difference lies in the randomness of success and failure, and in the lethal consequences of characters making poor choices.  
While in a book the good guys win and the hero always escapes just in time, in a game the entire party could fail to arrive on time, 
or the valiant knight could step on a trap plate and be crushed by a rock.  The dice give, the dice they take away.
</p> -->

<h3>Q: What does old-school gaming mean?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
Focus on immersive play in the world of the game, and the exploration of the underground world of the dungeon, 
rather than on character builds, game mechanics, or balanced combat encounters.  
The internal logic of the game world is as much a determining factor as dice rolls.  
</p><p>
Play is classic pen-and-paper, with a mix of theatre-of-the-mind and miniature figurines.  
Your skill and imagination as a player is more important to success than the boxes on your char sheet.  
The dungeon is the underground world of the unknown, full of horrible monsters and deadly traps; 
you don't know what you will find, or if you will survive.
</p>

<h3>Q: Are these one-shots, or campaigns?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
You decide.  Tell me beforehand what you intend, and I will tailor to that.  If you change your mind 
after the first session, then I will adapt.
</p>

<h3>Q: Can you customize the game for a theme or event?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Customization is part of the premium value.  I re-prepare before each session, whether it is from a prewritten module 
or one I made myself, whether I've run this adventure before or not. 
I can make a custom module based on your theme (be exactly as specific as you want it), or 
run any prewritten module you would like.
</p>

<h3>Q: Is there a particular ruleset being used?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Rules I am familiar with: Chainmail + OD&D, AD&D (1E), Basic D&D (Holmes, B/X or OSE), 3E, 5E, and DCC.  
The way I actually play will be some mix of these.  
</p><p>
If you know you have a rules preference, then you may state so.
</p><p>
Many new players default to 5E, and can be insistent on it.  
Possibly, they think it is more "oficial."  
I am happy to run a 5E campaign.  But if you are only defaulting to 5E, then let me worry about rules.
</p><p>
Regardless of the rules, the style of play will aim towards classic, old-school gaming.
</p>

<h3>Q: When will we make our characters?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
My goal is that from the moment we sit down, the game will be as much continual action as possible.
</p><p>
To this end, character creation will use a "funnel" system.  You will create four characters.  
Each will be created in approximately thirty seconds by rolling <b>3d6 down the line</b>.
In the first adventure, all of them will die but one.  That sole survivor will continue as your character to the next adventure.  
That tale of how you survived will be your backstory.  
</p><p>
This system takes focus off of game mechanics, char-builds, and sorting through rule books, and puts focus back on immersive play.
</p><p>
	Do NOT bring your own pre-made character.
</p>

<h3>Q: Are there really no screens or phones?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
There are no tablets, phones, laptops, computers virtual tabletops, TVs, or any of it.  
I will take all notes on paper, and you will do the same.  A calculator is allowed, but likely not needed.  
Phones will be kept out of reach, on Do Not Disturb.
</p><p>
If you absolutely expect an important call (such as a parent, or wife going into labor), 
you may put that contact to an allow-list in case of an emergency call.  
Otherwise, you will not be able to see your device; it will stay stored even while you use the bathroom.
</p>


<!-- ABOUT THE DM -->
<h2 id="about">About the DM</h2>

<h3>Who will be the DM?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
I will.  There are no other DMs.  It will always be me at the table.
</p>

<h3>Q: Who are you?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
My name is Reece Boston, PhD. 
During the day I am a computational physicist at the nearby lab.  
<!-- I live in the Knoxville area with my wife and two children, and we are active members of a local church.   -->
In the past I have been a university professor, a high school teacher, and a software engineer.  
That said, my games are not about physics, education, or software.  They are about monsters, dungeons, and adventures.
</p>

<h3>Q: Why should I want to hire you specifically?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
My experience of the game spans eras.  Before 3E, before even 2E and the rise of "Trad"-style gaming, to the original madhouse, DM-controlled 
chaos of the early generations of gamers.  That's the kind of game I am offering.
</p><p>
I am offering an in-person experience.  The game is meant to be played in dusty basements or kitchen tables.   
Most DMs-for-Hire are only willing to play online through virtual tabletops.  That makes it easier for the DM to get players, 
but completely changes the human experience of playing in a room with people.  
</p><p>
	Finally, I bring my uniquely considered, intelligent, and artisanal approach to the game.
</p>

<h3>Q: What got you interested in gaming?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
As a boy, I was already obsessed with the <i>Hobbit</i> movie (Rankin/Bass 1979), stories of knights and dragons, 
and the original three Zelda games.  Then I discovered my dad's worn-out copies of the 1E DMG and Holmes bluebook.
</p><p>
There is no better way to describe the 1E DMG by Gary Gygax, than as an in-universe relic written by a mad wizard.  
He has the arcane knowledge, and is trying to communicate it.  If only you knew what he was trying to describe.  
I didn't understand, but I knew I wanted to.
</p>

<h3>Q: What fiction is influential to your games?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
The below are not necessarily my favorite books, but they have been the most influential on my game:
</p><dl>
	<dt>The Hobbit and LOTR</dt><dd>JRR Tolkien</dd>
	<dt>The Broken Sword</dt><dd>Poul Anderson</dd>
	<dt>King Arthur and His Knights</dt><dd>Howard Pyle</dd>
	<dt>The Song of Rolland</dt><dd>Carolingian Cycle</dd>
	<dt>Conan the Barbarian</dt><dd>Robert E Howard</dd>
	<dt>Elric of Melnibone</dt><dd>Michael Moorcock</dd>
	<dt>The Dying Earth</dt><dd>Jack Vance</dd>
	<dt>The Maze of Peril</dt><dd>John Eric Holmes</dd>
	<dt>Earthsea</dt><dd>Ursula Le Guin</dd>
	<dt>The Book of Three</dt><dd>Lloyd Alexander</dd>
	<dt>The Last Unicorn</dt><dd>Peter Beagle</dd>
	<dt>Fairy Tales</dt><dd>George MacDonald</dd>
</dl><p>
This is <i>my</i> list, but if you would like a ful list of material that inspired the original creators of the game, 
then consult the <a href="http://www.digital-eel.com/blog/ADnD_reading_list.htm">Appendix N list</a>.
</p>

<h3>Q: What about sci-fi?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
I do like to read sci-fi, but only started as an adult.  I have never played a sci-fi game.
</p><p> 
At the moment, I would not agree to a sci-fi game, because I could not guarantee quality of experience.  
This may change in the future.
</p>

<h3>Q: Do you hate technology?  Why no screens?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
No.  I program computers for a living, and wrote this webpage myself in vanilla HTML.  
</p><p>
Everything in moderation.  Playing in-person and not online seems like a step toward moderation.
</p><p>
The ban on screens is a purely practical concern.  
Even when playing in-person, screen-distraction is a recurring annoyance.  
Out of force of habit, players disconnect periodically to check the socials, and it detracts from everyone's experience. 
If you are playing on a screen, or playing with people holding screens, it will make the game slower and less engaging.
</p><p>
Screen addiction is so bad, if you <i>see me</i> looking at a screen (even a laptop with DM notes), it will 
still trigger you to reach for your phone.  I don't want that.  People played without digital tools for thirty years; 
we can too.
</p>

<!-- PARENTAL -->
<h2 id="parental">Questions a Parent Might Ask</h2>
<p>
	There is no maximum age, so long as your imagination still works.  I do not run "kid games", 
	though I may run a game where the players are kids.  This section is for the parents of those kids, 
	to explain what safety and content measures are in place.
</p>

<h3>Q: How do I know you're not a crazy weirdo?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
Fair question.  You can view my professional bio 
on <a href="https://github.com/rboston628">github</a>, 
or on <a href="https://reeceboston.com/">my personal website</a>.  
I am background-checked, drug-free, a dad to two, have a mortgage, and drive a Honda Odyssey.  
</p>

<h3>Q: I would like to hire you for my teenagers; but how can I know my child is safe?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
I'm a parent, so I understand this concern.  It was part of my motivation for starting Dr. Dungeon.  
Consider the following points:
</p><ol style="width: 600px;">
	<li>You will choose the venue.  I can go to your house, or we can find a semi-public meeting area.</li>
	<li>You will choose the people at the table.  I will not bring anyone else to play.</li>
	<li>Though phones are not allowed, most phones have an allow-list setting so they will still ring 
		when on Do Not Disturb.  Please set this up prior to the game.
	</li>
	<li>You can remain during the game.  For the same of everyone's enjoyment, I do want to strike a balance 
		of parental presence.  We can discuss what you are comfortable with.
	</li>
	<li>You can arrange family games.  This is increasingly common.  
		Make sure your teenager would really enjoy playing with you.  Don't be offended if not. </li>
	<li>There will be a pre-game parental agreement form regarding participants and content.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Q: What age range is appropriate?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
I would recommend 11 and older.  Younger children have vivid imaginations, but are not as receptive to structure 
(e.g. failing to realize what they imagine because a dice roll failed).  
</p><p>
	While children <i>can</i> play, this is not a kids game.  There are retirees who have been playing for decades.  
	The game arose from wargames, which were considered a serious hobby for adult academics.  Don't feel shy about 
	arranging an adults-only session.
</p>

<h3>Q: Do you allow for mixed groups (kids and adults)?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
I require from all parents in writing that they are aware of who else is playing.  Those players, and myself, will be 
the only people at the table.
</p>

<h3>Q: Are the themes or materials religious / political / controversial?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
No.  D&D is fantasy escapism.  
Deliberately drawing in or commenting on real-world issues and events is a form of violence to the game.  
It is disrespectful to the players, and disrespectful to the world of the game.
</p>

<h3>Q: Are the games scary, violent, or dark?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
<!-- The game mimics heroic fantasy and mythology.  In heroic fantasy, heroes distinguish themselves precisely by their prowess in battle.  
The characters will be exploring underground ruins, and will encounter monstrous creatures.  It is not required they <i>fight</i> the monsters; 
in fact, it is usually smarter to try to evade monsters entirely.  But they will sometimes encounter hostile monsters with no chance of escape, 
and fighting may be their only way to survive.
</p><p>
Some "monsters" may actually be evil men lurking in the dark corners of the dungeon.  While you are not required to <i>fight</i> these 
evil characters, you will often be required to <i>stop</i> them from their sinister plans.  How you do that is really up to you.
</p><p> -->
I do not like games that are deliberately dark, edgy, or in-your-face.  It can feel immature, 
and can distract from the game itself to focus on an audience reaction.  
The tone I aim for is in the orbit of King Arthur, Lord of the Rings, or Conan the Barbarian.  It will not 
be like a slasher horror movie.
</p><p>
I want to play the game that you are comfortable playing.  Just let me know what elements concern you.
</p>


<!--MISC-->
<h2 id="misc">Miscellaneous</h2>

<h3>Q: What does "Gygaxian" mean?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
D&D began with two visionaries: Dave Arneson, who developed the concept; and Gary Gygax, who built up the formal system.  
Gygaxian often refers to the florid style of prose used in the original Dungeon Master's Guide, and in his published adventures.  
The word can also refer to play which is unbalanced, unpredictable, and highly deadly, requiring wise choices from players.
</p>

<h3>Q: How did you make your fliers?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
I drew them, by hand.  
The flier is exactly what my game is: 
honest, organic gaming with human imagination.
</p>

<h3>Q: Can you teach me how to run my own game?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b> 
I can.  The most fun way to learn is by arranging to play several sessions.  
On request, I an arrange sessions that are more geared at teaching how to run the game.
</p>

<h3>Q: I have a question not addressed here: how can I get in contact?</h3>
<p><b>A:</b>
You can contact me at <a href="mailto:"></a>.
