<h1>DR DUNGEON</h1>

<h2>Gaming Style</h2>

<h3>Classic / Old-School Play</h3>
<p>
	Generally, old-school play will focus on the following:
</p><ul>
	<li>Overcoming challenges: monsters, traps, or puzzles</li>
	<li>Playing the world, with its own self-consistent logic</li>
	<li>Player creativity over char-sheets</li>
	<li>Dungeoneering: mapping, tapping, and making sure the last torch doesn't burn out</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rule Zero</h3>
<p>
	This rule is called Rule Zero, because it comes before any and all other rules.  Simply:
</p><blockquote>
	<b>The game works however the DM says it does.</b>
</blockquote><p>
	The rulebook might say otherwise, but the rulebook isn't running the game.
</p><p>
	If this sounds tyrannical, remember: the DM is a <i>fellow player</i>.  The DM is <i>NOT</i> an adversary.
</p><p>
	It would not be fun if the DM were delibertely combating you  <i>and</i> arbitrating rules at the same time.  
	But that is not what Rule Zero implies.
</p>

<h3>The Quiet Game</h3>
<p>
	You are have pushed aside ancient cobwebs and mouldering remnants of a long-disused wooden door, 
	and descended the cold stone stairs into darkness.  Your torchlight casts a faint sphere of knowableness 
	against the oppressive black stare of the underground gloom.
</p><p>
	You hear a noise, like a slobbering tongue scraping a wooden bowl.
</p><p>
	You are, of course, actually perfectly comfortable while reading the above text.  But your character is not.
</p><p> 
	You are, of course, not actually worried about this horrible sound.  But your character is.
</p><p>
	What would worry you, however, would be if the DM calls for a dice roll.  Calling for 
	unexpected or even unexplained dice rolls is part of what is called the "quiet game."
</p><p>
	The "quiet game" is how we bridge the gap between you and your character.  You will not know if that sound 
	was a rat, or somthing much worse.  You will roll, and nothing will happen.  What did you avoid?  Or did you?
	You will roll high, and it won't reassure you.  What else might you have failed to notice?
</p>

<h3>Story vs. History</h3>
<p>
	In a game, there are characters acting in a shared imaginative world.  There are heroes, villains, momsters, quests, and 
	sometimes the fate of the world in the balance.  In this sense, a game shared many qualities with a story, 
	like the kind you would read in a fantasy novel.
</p><p>
	However, there are critical differences.
</p><p>
	Truly good books do not make for good games.  And truly good games do not make good books.
</p><p>
	A truly good book is <i>planned</i> by an author.  The author knows the start and the end, and the characters have to 
	generate that end from that beginning, somehow between the first and last pages.  Inbetween, the characters cannot stray 
	too far, or the plot would come apart.  It is a tell-tale sign 
	of bad writing when implausible scenarios or breaks of character contrive to make a plot point work; when it feels forced.  
	In truly good writing, every character decision feels natural, and every success feels earned.
</p><p>
	That is not achievable in a game where players have true agency.
</p><p>
	A truly good game is <i>unplanned</i>.  No single human agent, nor even group of agents, is able to determine beforehand 
	what will happen in a session until it actually happens.  Even the element of human interaction is unpredictable.  
	Dice rolls add true randomness to outcomes.  Players will make either impossibly foolish or unforseeably clever decisions 
	that will take the entire course of a campaign in a direction that no one would have known was coming.
</p><p>
	It is more appropriate to compare games to history.  The story we make is a small piece of the chronicle of the 
	world of the game, which we will realize together.
</p>

<!-- <p>
	There is a style of gaming called a "storygame," and rulesets tailored to this style.  
	A storygame aims to create a collaborative story, like the kind you would read in a novel.  
	These stories have clear storylines, character arcs, and satisfying resolutions.  
</p><p>
	Truly good stories are <i>planned</i>.  The author knows how they start and where he wants them to go.  
	And in between, the characters cannot stray too far from the final vision.  There msut necessarily be 
	some restriction on player agency
</p>><p>
	Classic games make histories.
</p><p>
	King Harold Godwinson was the Anglo-Saxon king of England when his country was attacked by William of Normandy.  
	He marshalled his forces to battle, and met with William's forces at the Battle of Hastings.  
	Weather had destroyed much of the Norman fleet, and Harold met them in force.  This was the beginning of an excellent 
	story, of a patriotic fight for a homeland, repelling the invaders in a glorious last stand, with a satisfying and victorious ending.
	But then Harold was struck by an arrow, and he died.
</p><p>
  That is the kind of story that we make in classic gaming.
</p><p>
	While there is a kind of fun from literally applying the rulebook rules, 
	especially to contrive silly scenarios made by corner cases, my experience shows the game is 
	actually more fun if  we play as though the world were real.
</p><p> 
	The rules are only to help us adjudicate how the world responds.
</p><p>
	focuses on overcoming challenges through a combination of character ability and player skill.  
	The choices you make as a player, and the possibly lethal consequences of your choices, are what drive the game.  
	You are meant to play the world of the game <i>as</i> a world with its own self-consistent logic, and the rules 
	are there only to facilitate.  The DM is there to decide how the rules apply, or which rules apply, or to 
	make new rules for the situation.
</p><p>
	This is distinct from other styles, including storygaming and neo-trad gaming.  In storygaming, the goal is 
	not to play the world but to create a story-like narrative with clear character arcs.  In neo-trad gaming, 
	there is a stronger focus on player character ability and character builds, 
	adheres to a form of rules-as-written textualism, and considers the role of the DM to assemble published resources 
	into a working game that the players interact with to make a story.  
</p><p>
	The "quiet game" is a facet of classic play which bridges the gap between your character's mental state, 
	and your own mental state.  During exploration, the DM will often call for apparently pointless dice rolls.  
	You may roll to detect or notice a threat, or to avoid a trap, or a saving throw, and yet 
	neither failure nor success seems to have any effect.
</p><p>
	But you will never actually know.  
	Did it have no effect?  
	Did it have an effect you just haven't noticed yet?
</p><p>
	And sometimes you will know; you will fail and something bad will happen.
</p><p>
	This helps to simulates the paranoia your character feels, hyper-aware to any sound echoing 
	in the stone confines of the underworld.

<h2>Gaming Background</h2>
<p>
When I was in elementary school in the 90's, I found a copy of Holmes Basic D&D ("bluebook") 
and his copy of the 1E DMG (by Gary Gygax) on a bookshelf in our house. 
I then spent the next month locked in my room, devouring these book.  They were way too advanced 
for me, but I knew I wanted to play, so I found my own ways.  
With my friends, we made "games" using hand-drawn or puzzle-book mazes, and penciled in monsters, weapons, 
obstacles, locks, and challenged the others to "solve" our maze.  
</p><p>
	My first "real" games were with friends in my basement or around our wooden barn-door kitchen table.  
	I ran them through multi-level dungeons, with strata of architecture transitioning from goblin mines, 
	to dwarven ruins, to long-sealed crypts of necromancers and the lairs of monstrous purple worms.
</p><p>
	When 3E came out, there were ust too many rules.  While the d20 mechanic was a helpful simplification, 
	all of the other excesses of precise contingencies, skills, abilities, feats, made it too difficult to run, 
	and I found with all there was to remember and track, that I was more like a human computer than a DM.
	So instead, I continued running games the way I already knew. 
</p><p>
	I have gone on to play in other systems, and there is no wrong fun.  But I still prefer to run games the way I know how.
